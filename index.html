    <h1>George Kelly</h1>
    <p>This website will introduce some basic info about George Kelly, as it was the topic of my psychology seminar paper.</p>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>The most appropriate term for Kelly’s theory of personal constructs would be a “ theory about theories”. In Kelly’s opinion all people anticipate events by the meanings or interpretations they place on those events. He calls this interpretations as construct. George Kelly based his theory on the statement, that people exist in a real world, but their behavior is shaped by their gradually expanding interpretation or construction of that world. What means, that people construe their world in their own way.  This philosophical position is called constructive alternativism. This theory is supporting by 11 corollaries, which assume that people’s activity is guided by the way anticipate events.</p>
