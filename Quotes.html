    <p><br>I have been so puzzled over the early labelling of personal construct theory as ‘cognitive’ that several years ago I set out to write another short book to make it clear that I wanted no part of cognitive theory. George A. Kelly. The Psychotherapeutic Relationship. 1965. p. 216<br>

<br>The labyrinth is conceived as a network of constructs, each of which is essentially an abstraction and, as such, can be picked up and laid down over many, many different events in order to bring them into focus and clothe them with personal meaning. Moreover, the constructs are subject to continual revision, although the complex interdependent relationship between constructs in the system often makes it precarious for the person to revise one construct without taking into account the disruptive effect upon major segments of the system. George A. Kelly, "Man's construction of his alternatives." Assessment of human motives (1958): 33-64.<br>

<br>Man develops his way of anticipating events by construing, by scratching out his channels of thought. Thus he builds his own maze. His runways are the constructs he forms, each a two-way street, each essentially a pair of alternatives between which he can choose. George A. Kelly, "Man's construction of his alternatives." Assessment of human motives (1958): 33-64.<br></p>
