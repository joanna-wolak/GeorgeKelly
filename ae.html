			<h1 id="headh1">Anticipation of events</h1>
			

		   <p>Anticipation of events suggests that people guide their actions according to the ways they predict the future.<br><br>
			„ It is the future which tantalizes man, not the past. Always he reaches out to the future through the window of the present”. <br><br>
			This quotation by George Kelly underlines, that our present view is the most influential factor, which shapes our actions. And only our present interpretation are subject to change.  He believed that not the facts, but the person, has the key to an individual’s future.<br><br>
			Kelly’s basic postulate, which assumes that our psychological processes are directed by the ways in which we anticipate events, is supporting by 11 corollaries.
