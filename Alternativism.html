    <h1>Constructive Alternativism</h1>
    <p id="polozenie">The theory of Constructive Alternativism explains, that the universe really exists. Also the world in which we live is continually changing, so that something is happening all the time. We have to add to these basic assumptions, that people’s thoughts also really exist and that people try to make sense of their continuously changing world. It is important to underline, that all people always have alternative ways of looking at things. Different people construe reality in different ways and we are able to change our view of the world. What in other words means, that the world in which we live, is continually changing interpretations or points of view. Let’s have a look at more practical example of constructive alternativism.<br> We can imagine a situation of a boy, who is late for school. His father may think, that the boy is late because he is lazy. His mother may think, that her son is forgetful and he was dreaming on the way to school. His teacher may see it as a sign of his distaste for school. His friend might see it as an accident. The boy himself can see his lateness as an indication of his inferiority. We can see that one event lead to creation of many different alternative constructions, that may lead to different actions.</p>
