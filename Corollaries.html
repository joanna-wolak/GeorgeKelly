<h1>11 Corollaries by George Kelly</h1>
<table id="table1">
       
    <tr>
    <th>Construction Corollary</th>
    <td>says that we anticipate future events according to our interpretations of current themes</td>
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Individuality Corollary</th>
    <td>people have different experiences and, therefore, construe events in different ways</td>
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Organization Corollary</th>
    <td>we organize our personal constructs in hierarchical system,this organization allows us to minimize incompatible constructs</td>
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Dichtomy Corollary</th>
    <td>all personal constructs are dichotomous, that is, we construe events in an either/ or manner</td>
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Choice Corollary</th>
    <td>underlines Kelly's belief that a person is free and able to choose from among the various alternatives the construct that will be most useful</td>
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Range Corollary</th>
    <td>constructs are limited to a particular range of convenience, that is, they are not relevant to all situations</td>
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Experience Corollary</th>
    <td>we continually revise our personal constructs as the result of experience</td>
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Modulation Corollary</th>
    <td>not all new experiences lead to a revision of personal constructe</td>
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Fragmentation Corollary</th>
    <td>our behavior is sometimes inconsistent because our construct system can readily admit incompatible elements</td>
    
  </tr>    
	<tr>
    <th>Commonality Corollary</th>
    <td>to the extent that we have had experiences similar to others,our personal construct tend to be similar to the construct of those people</td>
    
  </tr>   
	<tr>
    <th>Sociality Corollary</th>
    <td>we are able to communicate with others because we can construe their constructions</td>
