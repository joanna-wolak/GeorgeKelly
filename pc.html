				<tr><td>1.</td><td>Construction Corollary</td><td>says that we anticipate future events according to our interpretations of current themes</td></tr>
				<tr><td>2.</td><td>Individuality Corollary</td><td>people have different experiences and, therefore, construe events in different ways </td></tr>
				<tr><td>3.</td><td>Organization Corollary</td><td>corollary We organize our personal constructs in hierarchical system,this organization allows us to minimize incompatible constructs </td></tr>
				<tr><td>4.</td><td>Dichtomy Corollary</td><td>all personal constructs are dichotomous, that is, we construe events in an either/ or manner</td></tr>
				<tr><td>5.</td><td>Choice Corollary</td><td>underlines Kelly's belief that a person is free and able to choose from among the various alternatives the construct that will be most useful</td></tr>
				<tr><td>6.</td><td>Range Corollary</td><td>constructs are limited to a particular range of convenience, that is, they are not relevant to all situations</td></tr>
				<tr><td>7.</td><td>Experience Corollary</td><td>we continually revise our personal constructs as the result of experience</td></tr>
				<tr><td>8.</td><td>Modulation Corollary</td><td>not all new experiences lead to a revision of personal constructe</td></tr>
				<tr><td>9.</td><td>Fragmentation Corollary</td><td>our behavior is sometimes inconsistent because   our construct system can readily admit incompatible elements</td></tr>
				<tr><td>10.</td><td>Commonality Corollary</td><td>to the extent that we have had experiences similar to others,our personal construct tend to be similar to the construct of those people</td></tr>
				<tr><td>11.</td><td>Sociality Corollary</td><td>we are able to communicate with others because we can construe their constructions</td></tr>
