Kelly was a former schoolteacher. Both parents were well-educated and both helped in the formal education of their only child. At the age of 13 he was sent to school in Witchita. Kelly was a good example, especially after high school, of someone who was interested in everything and basically directionless. He received bachelor's degree in 1926 in physics and math from Park College. But his interest in social problems led him to the University of Kansas, where he received a masterâ€™s degree in sociology. George Kelly was moving a lot during his life. First he moved to Minneapolis, then he moved to Sheldon, Iowa, where he taught and coached drama at a junior college. After few years, he went to the University of Edinburgh in Scotland, where he received a bachelor of education degree in psychology. In 1931, he received his Ph.D. in psychology from the State University of Iowa. In 1931 Kelly returned once again to Kansas, where he began his academic career. He was teaching psychology at Fort Hays State College, where he developed his theory and clinical techniques. During the World War 2, he joined the Navy as an aviation psychologist. After Second World War he taught at the University of Maryland for a year. After that he joined the faculty at Ohio State University as a professor and director of the Psychological Clinic. George Kelly died on March 6, 1967, at the age of 61.
